    Two plans are being maintained simulataneously: a nominal and an emergency plan.
      <br />
    The sound signals contain the Fourier Tranformed frequency content of each new
      <br />
    new plan as its published by the path-planning controller. The plans are initially
      <br />
    different, but they converge as the emergency occurs.

    It didn't turn out very musical, but very fun to learn how to pipe so much
      <br />
    data (1560 individual oscillators!) into a javascript audio context.
      <br />
    Now that I've worked through the coding implementation details, I hope to have
      <br />
    more time in future assignments to think about composition.

    Not sure what the crackling is -- maybe overloading the browser's player?
      <br />
    If playing this data gives your browser problems, I can reduce the size.
      <br />
    Duration for each button: ~ 20 seconds.

    Two plans are being maintained simulataneously:
      <br />
    a nominal plan and a an emergency avoidance plan.
      <br />
    They converge as the emergency occurs.

    It didn't turn out very musical, but very fun to learn how to pipe so much
      <br />
    data (1620 individual oscillators!) into a javascript audio context.
      <br />
    Now that I've worked through the coding implementation details, I hope to have
      <br />
    more time in future assignments to think about composition!
      <br /><br />

    Not sure what the crackling is -- maybe overloading the browser's player?
      <br />
    If playing this data gives your browser problems, I can reduce the size.
